    Sherlock(optimizer, Ïµ::Float64)

Sherlock combines local and global search to estimate the range of the output node.

# Problem requirement
1. Network: any depth, ReLU activation
2. Input: hpolytope and hyperrectangle
3. Objective: Any linear objective

# Method
Branch and bound with bound tightening at each step in the simplex

# Property
Sound and complete
