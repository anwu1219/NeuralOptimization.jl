# NeuralOptimization.jl

Welcome to NeuralOptimization.jl! The goal of this is to provide a common API to interact with many different neural optimization algorithms. It is inspired by [NeuralVerification.jl] (https://github.com/sisl/NeuralVerification.jl). 

It will allow access to the following approximate algorithms for generating adversarial examples:
